#### Team Leadership and Relationship Building

*The best results come from a team that supports each other and openly discusses opportunities and challenges.*

There will always be conflicting views and opinions within development teams. I’ve taken an active role in leading team ceremonies and aim to create an up-beat, solution-focused environment where all members feel comfortable contributing and comparing possible solutions. 

#### Proactive and Independent Learner 

*I love exploring new technologies and find it imperative to know how my code works.* 

Whether it’s setting up new API integrations or exploring tools to automate repetitive tasks. I’m always looking for opportunities to understand the codebase and tech stack better. I seek out opportunities to pair with senior members of the team and often organise brown bag sessions to share my learning with other team members. I’ve given brown bag sessions on topics including Docker, our A/B testing platform and explaining our deployment process with new joiners.
