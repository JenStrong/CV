I am a junior full stack developer focused on transforming my love for logical problem solving into a career in web development. I'm drawn to the tech industry because of its seemingly limitless potential to drastically change the world on a large scale. I am looking to join a company that provides a supportive learning environment while simultaneously embracing innovation, and meaningful work.

### Proactive and Independent Learner 

*I love exploring new technologies and find it imperative to know how my code works.* 

Whether it's working out how to add a flex box to a web app or diving deeper into understanding user authentication, I aim to understand the inner workings of the code I'm writing. I push myself to use the official documentation when learning new technologies. 

### Collaborative Team Member and Pair Programmer

*I believe the best ideas and the best code come out of focused individuals working together in a supportive, non-judgemental environment.*

Pair programing has been an essential aspect in my learning how to code. I've found that working on code with others results in more readable code with fewer bugs. Previous team members have commented on my balanced perspective when considering different approaches to coding challenges and have said they appreciated my ability to think through my ideas before presenting them to the group.
